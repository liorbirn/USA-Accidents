# USA-Accidents
Car accidents are a huge problem in our world. Nearly 1.3 million people die internationally every year from car accidents and in addition up to 50 million people are injured. Many governments collect accident records and make these data publicly available. In this project I took a dataset that is covers 49 states of the USA. The accident data are collected from February 2016 to Dec 2021, using multiple APIs that provide streaming traffic incident (or event) data. These APIs broadcast traffic data captured by a variety of entities, such as the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within the road-networks. Currently, there are about 2.8 million accident records in this dataset.
